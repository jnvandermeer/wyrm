Todo
====

* firls (least squares filter)? anstatt butterworth
* remove dead/noisy channels methods
* Make sphinx document Data.__ne__, __nonzero__, etc.

Done
====

* plot r2 from top to botton left to right
* LDA + lda shrink
* check csp for correctness
* check if all methods deal with emtpy data correctly and use truthy value of
  data to test if its emtpy
* append_cnt is really useless, it does not handle marker and axis[timeaxis]
  correctly
* fix/deal w/ Ringbuffer w/ subsampled data?
    - maybe adding a FIFO before the ringbuffer could help, the FIFO could have
      an append and get method and get return either nothing or data of len >=
      SIZE
* Check marker bug for all remaining tb methods
* How to create empty (no data) Data objects?
